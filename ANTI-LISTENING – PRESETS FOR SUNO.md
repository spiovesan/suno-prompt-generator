## LYRIC TEMPLATE 1 — ANTI-LISTENING (CONTROLLED)

[Opening Field]
(intervallic harmonic block, no tonal center)
(chromatic vertical cluster, avoid triadic harmony)
(non-functional harmony, no root motion)

[Primary Material]
(fragmented thematic cell, harmonic displacement)
(asymmetric phrase length, tonal center displaced)
(fragmented thematic cell, chromatic instability)

[Transition]
(abrupt harmonic interruption)
(abrupt harmonic interruption)

[Thematic Field]
(intervallic harmonic block, avoid triadic harmony)
(non-parallel harmonic shift, no functional root motion)
(chromatic vertical cluster, unstable harmonic field)

[Instrumental Break]
(lead guitar solo, angular phrasing, harmony remains unstable)
(lead guitar solo, sparse gestures, vertical harmony emphasis)

[Final Field]
(harmonic field transforms, still no tonal center)
(chromatic suspension, no cadence)

[Outro]
(harmonic suspension, unresolved ending)

[Instability Field]
(non-parallel harmonic blocks, no progression)
(intervallic collision, tonal center erased)
(chromatic vertical mass, no functional grounding)

[Instrumental Break]
(lead guitar solo, sparse angular gestures)
(lead guitar solo, physical but intentionally awkward)

# STYLES / DESCRIPTIONS

## STYLE A — CONTEMPORARY CHAMBER JAZZ

Instrumental only, no vocals. Contemporary chamber jazz and modern improvised music with ECM-like and post-tonal aesthetics. Focus on vertical harmony, intervallic structures and harmonic fields instead of functional progressions. Steady tempo without groove repetition, no swing or fusion clichés. Clean electric guitar as primary voice, switching briefly to restrained lead guitar during the solo, then returning clean. Music is intentionally non-soothing, non-background, with persistent harmonic tension and no tonal resolution.

---

## STYLE B — POST-TONAL IMPROVISED MUSIC

Instrumental only, no vocals. Post-tonal improvised music influenced by contemporary classical language and modern jazz abstraction. Emphasis on non-functional harmony, chromatic instability and asymmetric phrasing rather than themes or grooves. Rhythm section avoids repetition and supports harmonic instability. Guitar is used as a textural and intervallic instrument, becoming a restrained lead voice only in the solo before returning to clean texture. Intentionally anti-listening and resistant to passive enjoyment.

---

## STYLE C — RADICAL ANTI-LISTENING

Instrumental only, no vocals. Radical anti-listening music that resists comfort, memorability and tonal grounding. Harmony treated as unstable vertical blocks rather than progressions, avoiding triadic and functional motion. No groove repetition, no lyrical themes, no cinematic or fusion traits. Clean electric guitar used dry and unsweetened, briefly shifting to restrained lead guitar during the solo, then returning clean. Music remains unresolved, uncomfortable and non-functional by design.
