# Avoid too similar songs
We have this Suno prompt generator that gives this prompts like
"complex, smooth, modal piano harmonies, modern smooth jazz, jazz, groovy, featuring guitar lead, groovy bass line, complex chord progressions, bright modal flavor, cinematic modal jazz, expressive jazz guitar phrasing, flowing rhythmic feel, medium tempo, around 95 BPM, energetic, driving intensity, contemporary modern jazz, bass intro, minimal instrumentation building up"
even selecting different fields and refining with AI

## The problem
Almost all the sogngs created have these basic structure
IIm7-IVm7 (like Dm7-Gm7) or
VIm7-IVmaj7 (like Dm7-Bbmaj7)
I would like to have a different variety of chord combination

## Proposal
We should be able to propose a propmt that is a able to generate a major variery of songs
I can attach a set of sample songs if helpful
