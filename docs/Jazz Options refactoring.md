#  Jazz Options refactoring
I think we shold keep Jazz Options for all genre; maybe we call just Options; All the actual field should stay enabled

## Style Preset
The combo box should show show the same list but with the name of the genre.
I.e. instead of Smooth Jazz, if genre is Ambient, let call Smooth Ambient and so on. For all those name options without the genre name, let's add it

## Style Influence
Let's do the same as the Style Preset changes

## Other selection
Chord Progression, Harmonic Rhythm and Chord Extensions would not change

## Mode selection
Mode is not consistent with the Key
If the key is a major chord, the selection should be only
- Ionian, Lydian and Mixolydian
If the key is a minor chord, the selection should be only
- Doric, Phrigyan and Aeolian

## Update UI
Remove the (Jazz only) from Use LLM generation
Update the GUI to have the Options always visible
When changing the Genre, update the Style Preset and Style Influence selections
